# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** July 9th, 2025

## Why This Exists

Apple requires all extensions to have a privacy policy, so here we are. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## The Short Version

I don't collect any of your data. Period.

This extension runs entirely on your computer, highlights text when you select it, and that's it. No tracking, no analytics, no "telemetry for improving user experience" - none of that nonsense.

## What Actually Happens

When you use Selection Highlighter:

- It highlights text you select on web pages
- It saves your settings (like colors) using your browser's sync storage (so your settings can follow you if you use the same browser account on multiple devices)
- That's literally it

Everything stays on your device. I can't see what you're doing, what sites you visit, or anything else about you.

## Permissions

The extension needs a couple permissions to work:

- **Active Tab**: So it can highlight stuff on the page you're looking at
- **Storage**: So it can remember your settings
- **Host Permissions**: So it can work on websites

These aren't used for spying on you - they're just so the extension can do its job.

## Open Source

The code is all public on GitHub if you want to check for yourself: https://github.com/neaumusic/selection-highlighter

Feel free to poke around and verify that I'm not doing anything sketchy.
